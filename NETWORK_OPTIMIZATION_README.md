# Network-Aware Response Optimization

## Overview

AlertMate now includes **automatic network connectivity detection** and **bandwidth-optimized responses** to ensure reliable emergency communication even in poor network conditions, such as during stormy weather when 4G connectivity is degraded.

## Problem Solved

During emergency situations, users often experience:
- **Poor network connectivity** (slow 4G, 2G, or unstable connections)
- **High bandwidth costs** for emergency data usage
- **Long loading times** for verbose responses
- **Connection timeouts** due to large response payloads

Our network optimization system automatically detects these conditions and provides **minimal, bandwidth-efficient responses** while maintaining critical emergency information.

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Network Detection**
- **Client-side detection** using Browser Network Information API
- **Connection type detection** (2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi)
- **Real-time network quality monitoring**
- **Automatic adaptation** to network changes

### 2. **Smart Response Optimization**
- **Minimal responses** for slow connections (2G, poor 4G)
- **Standard responses** for fast connections (4G, WiFi)
- **Multi-language support** (English, Urdu, Roman Urdu)
- **Context-aware compression** based on urgency level

### 3. **Visual Network Status**
- **Real-time network quality indicator** in the chat interface
- **Connection type display** (2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi)
- **Response mode indicator** (Minimal/Standard)

## How It Works

### Network Quality Detection

```javascript
// Client-side detection
function detectNetworkQuality() {
    if ('connection' in navigator) {
        const connection = navigator.connection;
        connectionType = connection.effectiveType || connection.type;
        
        // Map to quality levels
        if (connectionType === 'slow-2g' || connectionType === '2g') {
            networkQuality = 'slow';
        } else if (connectionType === '3g') {
            networkQuality = 'medium';
        } else if (connectionType === '4g' || connectionType === 'wifi') {
            networkQuality = 'fast';
        }
    }
}
```

### Response Mode Selection

```python
def should_use_minimal_response(network_quality: NetworkQuality, urgency: int) -> bool:
    # Always use minimal for slow connections
    if network_quality == NetworkQuality.SLOW:
        return True
    
    # Use minimal for medium connections with high urgency (need quick responses)
    if network_quality == NetworkQuality.MEDIUM and urgency >= 2:
        return True
    
    # Use minimal for unknown connections (assume slow)
    if network_quality == NetworkQuality.UNKNOWN:
        return True
    
    return False
```

## Response Examples

### Stormy Weather Scenario (Poor 4G Connection)

**User Input:** "Heavy storm causing flooding, need emergency help"

**Minimal Response (Slow Network):**
```
🌪️ DISASTER | 🔴 U1 | ✓ Dispatched | ? Are you in imme...
```
*Length: 56 characters*

**Standard Response (Fast Network):**
```
Critical weather emergency detected
Priority level: 1 (1=low, 3=high). Keywords noted: storm, heavy rain, flooding, emergency.
I've routed this to the DISASTER team (subservice: evacuation_guidance). Action taken: emergency_evacuation_dispatched.
Heads-up: Need immediate evacuation details
Next step: Are you in immediate danger? How many people?
Additional info: shelter_locations: School A, Community Center B
```
*Length: 351 characters*

**Compression Ratio: 16%** (84% bandwidth savings!)

### Medical Emergency (Poor 3G Connection)

**Minimal Response:**
```
🏥 MEDICAL | 🔴 U1 | ✓ Dispatched | ? Conscious?
```
*Length: 48 characters*

**Standard Response:**
```
Medical emergency detected with bleeding concerns
Priority level: 1 (1=low, 3=high). Keywords noted: ambulance, bleeding, emergency.
I've routed this to the MEDICAL team (subservice: ambulance_dispatch). Action taken: dispatched_request_to_ambulance_provider.
Heads-up: Need more details
Next step: Is the patient conscious and breathing? Any heavy bleeding?
Additional info: dispatch_reference: AMB-1234-EMERGENCY, eta_minutes: 8
```
*Length: 412 characters*

**Compression Ratio: 12%** (88% bandwidth savings!)

## Multi-Language Support

### Urdu Minimal Responses
```
🏥 طبی | 🔴 فوری | ✓ بھیجا | ? ہوش میں؟
```

### Roman Urdu Minimal Responses
```
🏥 Medical | 🔴 Zaroori | ✓ Bhijaya | ? Hosh mein?
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Model Updates**
Added network quality fields to request models:
```python
class DispatchRequest(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    network_quality: Optional[str] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="User's network quality: 'slow', 'medium', 'fast', 'unknown'"
    )
    connection_type: Optional[str] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Connection type: '2g', '3g', '4g', 'wifi', 'unknown'"
    )
```

### 2. **Response Builder**
```python
def _build_chat_reply(front: FrontAgentOutput, service: ServiceAgentResponse, request: Optional[DispatchRequest] = None) -> str:
    if request:
        network_quality = detect_network_quality(request.network_quality, request.connection_type)
        use_minimal = should_use_minimal_response(network_quality, front.urgency)
        
        if use_minimal:
            return build_minimal_response(front, service, request.lang)
    
    return build_standard_response(front, service)
```

### 3. **Client Integration**
```javascript
// Send network info with requests
body: JSON.stringify({
    // ... other fields ...
    network_quality: networkQuality,
    connection_type: connectionType
})
```

## Benefits

- **Real-time network monitoring**
- **Seamless switching** between response modes

## Use Cases

### 1. **Natural Disasters**
- **Stormy weather** with degraded 4G
- **Earthquake zones** with network congestion
- **Flooded areas** with limited connectivity

### 2. **Remote Areas**
- **Rural locations** with 2G/3G only
- **Mountain regions** with poor signal

### 3. **Network Congestion**
- **Mass emergency events** causing network overload
- **Festival/event areas** with high user density
- **Peak usage times** with slow connections

## Testing

Run the network optimization tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_network_optimization.py -v
```

Test the stormy weather scenario:
```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.append('.')
from tests.test_network_optimization import test_stormy_weather_scenario
test_stormy_weather_scenario()
"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional configuration required - the system automatically detects network conditions.

### Browser Support
- **Chrome/Edge:** Full Network Information API support
- **Firefox:** Partial support (fallback to estimation)
- **Safari:** Fallback to estimation
- **Mobile browsers:** Native connection detection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Mode:** Cache responses for completely offline scenarios
2. **Progressive Loading:** Stream responses for very slow connections
3. **Compression:** Add gzip compression for additional bandwidth savings
4. **Predictive Optimization:** Use historical data to predict network quality
5. **Emergency Protocols:** Special ultra-minimal mode for critical situations

## Monitoring

The system logs network quality decisions:
```
INFO: Building response - network_quality: slow, connection_type: 4g, urgency: 1, use_minimal: True
```

Monitor these logs to understand network optimization effectiveness and user connectivity patterns.
